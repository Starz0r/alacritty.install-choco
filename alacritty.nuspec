[![Travis build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwilm/alacritty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jwilm/alacritty)
[![Appveyor build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jwilm/alacritty?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jwilm/alacritty)

Alacritty is the fastest terminal emulator in existence. Using the GPU for
rendering enables optimizations that simply aren't possible in other emulators.
Alacritty currently supports macOS and Linux, and Windows.

## About

Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance goal means
it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available. The simplicity
goal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be
better provided by a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

The software is considered to be at an **alpha** level of readiness--there are
missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily
driver.

Precompiled binaries are available for Windows through [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jwilm/alacritty).
Precompiled binaries for other platforms are minimally blocked on a stable config format. For now, Alacritty must be
built from source.

## Installation

Some operating systems already provide binaries for Alacritty, for everyone else the instructions
to build Alacritty from source, can be found [here](INSTALL.md).

### Windows

Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the artifacts section of [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jwilm/alacritty).

## Configuration

Although it's possible the default configuration would work on your system,
you'll probably end up wanting to customize it anyhow. There is a default
`alacritty.yml`, `alacritty_macos.yml`, and `alacritty_windows.yml` at the git repository root.
Alacritty looks for the configuration file as the following paths:

`%UserProfile%\alacritty.yml`

Many configuration options will take effect immediately upon saving changes to
the config file. The only exception is the `font` and `dimensions` sections
which requires Alacritty to be restarted. For further explanation of the config
file, please consult the comments in the default config file.

## Issues (known, unknown, feature requests, etc)

If you run into a problem with Alacritty, please file an issue. If you've got a
feature request, feel free to ask about it. Keep in mind that Alacritty is very
much not looking to be a feature-rich terminal emulator with all sorts of bells
and widgets. It's primarily a cross-platform, blazing fast `tmux` renderer that
Just Works.

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

In the terminals I've benchmarked against, alacritty is either faster, WAY
faster, or at least neutral. There are no benchmarks in which I've found
Alacritty to be slower.

**_My arrow keys don't work._**

It sounds like you deleted some key bindings from your config file. Please
reference the default config file to restore them.
